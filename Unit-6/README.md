# Unit 6 : Rules & Geofences

## Rules 
The rules engine provides a facility to continually monitor the device data and act upon it in an automated fashion. Rules can be set up which are comprised of a trigger (which notices when something has occurred) and a set of actions (which should be enacted when the rule fires). There is a variety of types of triggers and actions. Actions can be limited (throttled) so they do not enact too many times. A rule may be "active" or not to determine whether it should continually monitor the data and run actions or not.

## Geofence

This feature of the Davra Platform allows for the creation of Geofences which can be used to trigger events upon an IoT device entering or leaving. Users can create multiple 'zones' within a single Geofence, or have a single zone.
